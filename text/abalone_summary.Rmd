## Abalone 

## Age - length relationship/ key
The Sheppard data was used to develop an age-length key that could be used used to determine ages from the lengths collected from Gravina and Meares Pass. The Sheppard ablaone age-length data was collected in 1998, and the current length distributions are from 2016.

Due to the differences in both location and time, size frequency distribution comparisons were performed to determine if this was valid.  Visual inspection of these distributions suggests differences. These differences could be due to growth differences between locations, sampling methods changes, or recruitment pulses, to name a few.

A KS test was performed between Sheppard and Gravina which suggests that they are significantly different distributions (p-value <0.0001).  Age data and subsequent catch curve analysis should be interpreted with caution due to these differences. 

## catch curve
### Background
Catch curve assumptions (Smith et al. 2012): 

1) age composition data is estimated without error

2) recruitment is constant

3) Z is constant over time and across ages

4) above some determined age 


Common and accepted methods to estimate Z:

1) Regression estimate

2) Chapman and Robson estimator

3) Weighted Regression estiamte

The choice of ages to include in the catch curve analysis has been throughly examined by many studies (Dunn et al. 2002, Smith et al. 2012), although there is no clear consensus on which to use.  When estimating Z using catch curve methods, the age of full recruitment can be subjective.  Most often the peak age of abundance or the peak age of abundance plus 1 is used.  However, violations in the assumption of constant recruitment can alter the peak age to not coincide with the age of full recruitment.  Both peak age and peak age plus 1 were used here. 

Additionally, right truncation of the data set (excluding rare older ages) is commonly applied to reduce bias in estimates of Z.  Four common methods are: RG - use all age groups with nonzero catch, R1 - use all groups up to but not including the first age where catch is 0 or 1, R1' - uses all ages with nonzero catches up to and including the age after which all catches are less than 2, R1'' - uses all ages that have catches greater than 1 (Smith et al. 2012). 

### Sheppard data
The traditional catch curve methods, using the Sheppard data, yielded a Z estimate ranging from 0.51 to 0.49.  This appears high for the life history of abalone. 

Catch curve results:

```{r shp regression, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
shpab.sumlen <- read.csv("../output/shp_catchcurve.csv")
shpcc <- catchCurve(n~age, data = shpab.sumlen, ages2use = 5:13)
shpcc1 <- catchCurve(n~age, data = shpab.sumlen, ages2use = 6:13)
Shp <- cbind(Est = coef(shpcc), confint(shpcc))
Shp1 <- cbind(Est = coef(shpcc1), confint(shpcc1))

shp_reg <- cbind (peak = Shp[1, ], peak_plus = Shp1[1, ])
kable(shp_reg, caption = "Regression method, peak age = 5")
```

```{r shp chapman, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
shpCR <- chapmanRobson(n~age, data = shpab.sumlen, ages2use = 5:13)
shpCR1 <- chapmanRobson(n~age, data = shpab.sumlen, ages2use = 6:13)
Shp_cr <- cbind(Est = coef(shpCR), confint(shpCR))
Shp_cr1 <- cbind(Est = coef(shpCR1), confint(shpCR1))

shp_CR <- cbind (peak = Shp_cr[2, ], peak_plus = Shp_cr1[2, ])
kable(shp_CR, caption = "Chapman Robson method, peak age = 5")
```

```{r shp wtg regression, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
shpccW <- catchCurve(n~age, data = shpab.sumlen, ages2use = 5:13, use.weights = TRUE)
shpccW1 <- catchCurve(n~age, data = shpab.sumlen, ages2use = 6:13, use.weights = TRUE)
Shp_W <- cbind(Est = coef(shpccW), confint(shpccW))
Shp_W1 <- cbind(Est = coef(shpccW1), confint(shpccW1))

shp_WR <- cbind (peak = Shp_W[1, ], peak_plus = Shp_W1[1, ])
kable(shp_WR, caption = "Weighted regression method, peak age = 5")
```

Questions: 
Does a peak age of 5 make sense - that this would be the age they would full recruit to the adult population and to the fishery/ sampling methods?  If not what age would be more appropriate.  

Would you expect ages 4 and 5 to be that much greater than 6 to 13? or was there a recruitment pulse? A higher than normal recruitment pulse for ages 4 and 5 would inflat the estimate of Z, by creating an artifically high starting point for the linear catch curve analysis. 


### Gravina data 
The traditional catch curve methods were performed using the Gravina data that has the ages determined from an age-length key of the Sheppard data.  These yielded a Z estimate ranging from 0.52 to 0.44.  This appears high for the life history of abalone. 

Catch curve results:

```

The regression method uses all ages yielded a Z estimate of about 0.48, which is shown here as an example. 
![](../figs/regression_gravina.png)

Notice that the weighted regression method here does not differ from the regression method, this is due to adequate sample sizes and therefore the regression method does not need to be weighted by sample size. 

### Meares Pass data 
The Meares Pass data is sparse compared to the other areas, only a few organisms older than 4 years old were detected and most were only 1 year old.  Even though the highest density was at 1 year of age the peak age used in the catch curve was chosen to be the second highest at an age of 3. These catch curve results are not very robust due to the smaller sample sizes and age range.  
Additionally, the age range of the Meares Pass data (using the Sheppard age-length key) suggest it might have a different age-length relationship than Sheppard.  

Only the regression method was used since the data are not producing valid ranges (see the large confidence intervals). These yielded a Z estimate ranging from 0.88 to 0.50.  

Catch curve results:

```{r mrs regression, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
mrsab.sumlen <- read.csv("../output/mrs_catchcurve.csv")
mrscc <- catchCurve(n~age, data = mrsab.sumlen, ages2use = 2:9)
mrscc1 <- catchCurve(n~age, data = mrsab.sumlen, ages2use = 2:6)
mrscc2 <- catchCurve(n~age, data = mrsab.sumlen, ages2use = 3:9)
mrscc3 <- catchCurve(n~age, data = mrsab.sumlen, ages2use = 3:6)

mrsR <- cbind(Est = coef(mrscc), confint(mrscc))
mrsR1 <- cbind(Est = coef(mrscc1), confint(mrscc1))
mrsR2 <- cbind(Est = coef(mrscc2), confint(mrscc2))
mrsR3 <- cbind(Est = coef(mrscc3), confint(mrscc3))

mrs_R <- cbind (peak_all = mrsR[1, ], peak_plus_all = mrsR1[1, ], peak_10 = mrsR2[1, ], peak_plus_10 = mrsR3[1, ])

kable(mrs_R, caption = "Regression method, peak age = 2")
```

## Conclusions from catch curve for all areas 


## simulations to estimate Z
Preliminary examinations suggest that the values of Z achieved from multiple runs of the length data through the length-age key would not produce vastly different estimate of Z.  Intial runs of 100 suggest similar estimates that all fall within the confidence intervals provided here, at least for the Gravina data.  Mearses Pass length data does not have an adequate sample size to estimate Z well.
