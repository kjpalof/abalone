## Abalone 

## Age - length relationship/ key
The Sheppard data is used to develop an age-length key that was then used to determine ages from the lengths collected from Gravina and Meares Pass. The Sheppard ablaone age-length data was collected in 1998, and the current length distributions are from 2016.

Due to the differences in both location and time, size frequency distribution comparisons were performed to determine if this was valid.  Visual inspection of these distributions suggests differences. These differences could be due to growth differences between locations, sampling methods changes, or recruitment pulses, to name a few.

A KS test was performed between Sheppard and Gravina which suggests that they are significantly different distributions (p-value <0.0001).  Age data and subsequent catch curve analysis should be interpreted with caution due to these differences. 

## catch curve
### Background
The choice of ages to include in the catch curve analysis has been throughly examined by many studies (Dunn et al. 2002, Smith et al. 2012).  When using the regression method either the peak age to the age with <2 or the age after the peak age to age with <2.  Other methods have slight alterations to the ages used.  
Explain runs/method variations here and label them.


### Sheppard data
The traditional catch curve methods, using the Sheppard data, yielded a Z estimate of 0.49.  This appears high for the life history of abalone.  
Questions: 
Does a peak age of 5 make sense - that this would be the age they would full recruit to the adult population and to the fishery/ sampling methods?  If not what age would be more appropriate.  

Would you expect ages 4 and 5 to be that much greater or was there a recruitment pulse? A higher than normal recruitment pulse for ages 4 and 5 would inflat the estimate of Z, by creating an artifically high starting point for the linear catch curve analysis. 

Report results of multiple methods/ ages used.  Use actual data for this.

### Gravina data

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
